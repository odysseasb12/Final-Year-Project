This thesis explores the use of target detection models in computer vision to automate inspection tasks in the manufacturing process of medical devices, focusing on the recognition of stair lift components. The study compares various versions of the YOLOv5 architecture for this purpose, using a dataset of stair lift images captured with a mobile phone camera and prepared in Roboflow. The models are trained and evaluated on metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and loss functions. Results show accuracies above 97%, with YOLOv5x offering the highest accuracy but requiring more computational time. YOLOv5n strikes a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. The thesis also discusses limitations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in object detection and proposes future developments, such as batch normalization and multi-scale training, to address these challenges. Overall, YOLOv5n is recommended for similar applications due to its optimal balance of performance metrics and computational efficiency.
